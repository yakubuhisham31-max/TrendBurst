## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:** React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for server state, Shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI) for components, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

**Design System:** Features a custom color palette with light/dark mode support, Inter font family, consistent spacing, and a component library inspired by modern social platforms. Elevated card designs with shadow transitions enhance interactivity.

**Key Frontend Patterns:** Employs a component-based architecture, custom hooks for mobile detection and toast notifications, React Hook Form with Zod validation, and a mobile-first responsive design. Path aliases (`@/`, `@shared/`, `@assets/`) are used for clean imports.

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:** Node.js with Express.js, Drizzle ORM for database interaction, PostgreSQL (via Neon serverless), Vite for frontend builds, esbuild for backend bundling, and tsx for TypeScript development execution.

**Storage Interface:** Utilizes an abstract `IStorage` interface for CRUD operations, with an in-memory implementation (`MemStorage`) for development, designed for easy migration to persistent storage. User management is username-based.

**API Design:** Implements RESTful endpoints prefixed with `/api`, including request/response logging, JSON body parsing, and comprehensive error handling.

### Data Model

**Core Entities:**

*   **Users:** Manages authentication (username, password), profile information (bio, picture), and social statistics (followers, following) with UUIDs.
*   **Trends:** Stores creator reference, metadata (name, instructions, rules), category, engagement metrics (views, participants, chat count), optional cover pictures, and end dates.
*   **Posts:** Links to trends and users, contains media (image/video URL, type), optional captions, vote counts, and timestamps.
*   **Votes:** Connects posts, users, and trends, preventing duplicate votes and supporting ranking calculations.
*   **Comments:** Supports both post and trend-level discussions, with nested reply structures, user attribution, and timestamps.

**Database Schema Patterns:** Uses PostgreSQL with `gen_random_uuid()` for primary keys, foreign key relationships, text arrays for rules, `defaultNow()` for timestamps, and integer counters with default values.
