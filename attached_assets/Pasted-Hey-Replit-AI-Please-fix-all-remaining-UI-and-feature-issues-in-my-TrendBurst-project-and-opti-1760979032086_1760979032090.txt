Hey Replit AI 👋

Please fix all remaining UI and feature issues in my TrendBurst project and optimize the entire layout for a cleaner, modern, and consistent look.

Here’s the full list of fixes and improvements to apply:

1️⃣ UI / Layout Fixes
- Make the “Create Trend” button and the “Post” and “Chat” buttons in the trend feed sticky on the right side of the screen at all times.
- Ensure all logo sizes are consistent and visually balanced across every page.
- Make the back button on the category selection screen responsive and functional on both desktop and mobile.
- Review all page layouts and spacing — adjust paddings, margins, and element alignments for a neat and professional look.
- Improve sticky positioning and responsiveness without breaking existing design structure.

2️⃣ Functional Fixes
- Add “Education” as an option in the Categories section.
- Enable profile picture upload during both Sign-Up and Edit Profile.
- In Edit Profile, include fields for Full Name, Email, and allow users to Change or Update Password.
- Allow users to post both images and videos in the post feed.
- Display replies in chat as “Replied” below the message.
- Ensure the number of chats on each trend card excludes personal post comments.
- Make the “Share Profile” button fully functional and share the correct user profile link.

3️⃣ Dashboard & Analytics
- Add “Participation Rate” to each trend’s analytics in the dashboard to provide better insight into engagement metrics.

4️⃣ Content and Labels
- On the Create Trend page, replace the label “Reference Example” with simply “Reference”.

5️⃣ Authentication & Navigation
- Fix the issue where, after signing in, the user is not redirected to the dashboard/home screen.
- Make sure login, signup, and redirect flows work smoothly without refresh issues.

6️⃣ Final Polish & Optimization
- Verify all features above are functional after deployment.
- Ensure UI looks consistent on both light/dark themes (if any).
- Optimize component spacing, layout flow, and sticky elements for a clean and modern experience.

After finishing all of this, please test the app visually in preview mode to ensure that:
✅ Everything works as intended (frontend + backend)
✅ Layouts are clean and responsive
✅ Navigation, posting, and dashboard analytics function perfectly
